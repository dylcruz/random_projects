- [X] Refactor Outcome Functions:
    + You can consolidate the outcome functions (player_busts, player_wins, etc.) into a single function with parameters to specify the outcome. This reduces repetition.
- [ ] Avoid Using Global Variables:
    + The use of global variables like playing and player_win_bj can be minimized. You can pass these as parameters or manage them within classes or the main game loop.
- [ ] Implement Betting Limits:
    + You might consider adding minimum and maximum bet limits to make the game more realistic.
- [ ] Improve User Input Handling:
    + Use input validation functions to cleanly handle user inputs throughout the code.
